# Sensor-Management-System-using-MQTT-and-Python
A Python-based application for managing sensor data using MQTT. Includes database integration, real-time communication with sensors, and a user interface for monitoring measurements.
This project is a sensor management platform built with Python. It enables:

- Real-time data acquisition from sensors using MQTT
- Data storage and retrieval with a database
- A simple interface for monitoring and testing measurements

### Features
- MQTT integration (`mqtt.py`)
- Sensor data processing (`capteur.py`, `mesure.py`)
- SQLite or other DB interactions (`bdd.py`)
- User interface (`interface.py`)
- Main launcher (`app.py`)

### Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
